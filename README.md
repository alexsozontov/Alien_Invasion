My Own Version of Alien Invasion from the E-Book Python Crash Course by: Eric Matthes

1. In this game you have to shoot down aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.
2. When the player eliminates all the aliens on the screen a new fleet of aliens is created.
3. Every new level increases the tempo of the game and the amount of score rewarded by each alien.
4. Good luck!
